# PDF Print Scaler

PDF Print Scaler is an iOS app and [action extension](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/Action.html) that scales and prints a PDF.  Scaling is not the same as resizing. The original paper size is preserved; only the content is scaled. Thus, for a scale greater than 100%, some of the content will be cropped. For a scale less than 100%, the content will be padded with additional white space. This emulates the "Scale" option in the MacOS print dialog. This option is missing on iOS and iPadOS. This app allows you to adjust the margins on a PDF when you don't own the source from which the PDF was generated.
